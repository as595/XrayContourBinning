# Environment

The Dockerfile here is a copy of the [XMM-Newton SAS Dockerfile](https://gitlab.astro.unige.ch/ferrigno/sas-docker/-/tree/master), authored by Carlo Ferrigno. If you make use of it please reference Carlo's work.

The [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file in this repository is slightly updated in order to enable the PyContourBin functionality.
